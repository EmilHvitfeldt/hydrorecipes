The goal of hydrorecipes is to supplement the recipes package with a few
steps that can help deal with moderately sized water level datasets.

## Installation

You can install the development version of hydrorecipes from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jkennel/hydrorecipes")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(hydrorecipes)
#> Loading required package: recipes
#> Loading required package: dplyr
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'dplyr'
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
#> 
#>     filter, lag
#> The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
#> 
#>     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'recipes'
#> The following object is masked from 'package:stats':
#> 
#>     step
## basic example code
