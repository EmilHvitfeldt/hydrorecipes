\arguments{
\item{object}{either a 'recipe' or 'step' with grouped regressors.}

\item{...}{Currently not used}
}
\value{
A list of character vectors grouped by step.
}
\description{
Get the names of columns that are added grouped by the step.
}
\details{
In some cases regressors should be treated like a group.  This
often occurs when dealing with lagged relationships, and when doing signal
decomposition. This function attempts to get the names of new columns
created as a part of each step and returns it as a list having the same
length as the number of steps.
