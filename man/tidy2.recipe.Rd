\arguments{
\item{x}{A `recipe` object, step, or check (trained or otherwise).}

\item{number}{An integer or `NA`. If missing and `id` is not provided,
the return value is a list of the operations in the recipe.
If a number is given, a `tidy` method is executed for that operation
in the recipe (if it exists). `number` must not be provided if
`id` is.}

\item{id}{A character string or `NA`. If missing and `number` is not provided,
the return value is a list of the operations in the recipe.
If a character string is given, a `tidy` method is executed for that
operation in the recipe (if it exists). `id` must not be provided
if `number` is.}

\item{...}{Not currently used.}
}
\value{
A tibble with columns that vary depending on what
 `tidy` method is executed. When `number` and `id` are `NA`, a
 tibble with columns `number` (the operation iteration),
 `operation` (either "step" or "check"),
 `type` (the method, e.g. "nzv", "center"), a logical
 column called `trained` for whether the operation has been
 estimated using `prep`, a logical for `skip`, and a character column `id`.

\description{
`tidy2` will return a data frame that contains information
 regarding a recipe or operation within the recipe (when a `tidy2`
 method for the operation exists).
