A tibble with columns that vary depending on what
 `tidy2` method is executed. When `number` and `id` are `NA`, a
 tibble with columns `number` (the operation iteration),
 `operation` (either "step" or "check"),
 `type` (the method, e.g. "nzv", "center"), a logical
 column called `trained` for whether the operation has been
 estimated using `prep`, a logical for `skip`, and a character column `id`.

 regarding a recipe or operation within the recipe (when a `tidy`
 method for the operation exists).
