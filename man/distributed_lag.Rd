\title{distributed_lag}
\usage{
distributed_lag(x, basis_mat, knots)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the predictor variable.  Missing values are allowed.}

\item{basis_mat}{lag matrix for convolution}

\item{knots}{breakpoints that define the spline.  The default is no
    knots; together with the natural boundary conditions this results in
    a basis for linear regression on \code{x}.  Typical values are the
    mean or median for one knot, quantiles for more knots.  See also
    \code{Boundary.knots}.}
}
\value{
matrix with distributed lag terms
}
\description{
Depending on the vector to lag and the maximum knot, distributed_lag will
either use an FFT (no NA and large maximum knot), or a parallel method
(NA, or small maximum knot).
