\usage{
step_distributed_lag(
  recipe,
  ...,
  role = "predictor",
  trained = FALSE,
  knots = NULL,
  basis_mat = NULL,
  default = NA,
  prefix = "distributed_lag_",
  columns = NULL,
  skip = FALSE,
  id = rand_id("distributed_lag")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{recipe}{A recipe object. The step will be added to the
sequence of operations for this recipe.}

\item{...}{One or more selector functions to choose variables
for this step. See \code{\link[recipes:selections]{selections()}} for more details.}

\item{role}{For model terms created by this step, what analysis role should
they be assigned? By default, the new columns created by this step from
the original variables will be used as \emph{predictors} in a model.}

\item{trained}{A logical to indicate if the quantities for
preprocessing have been estimated.}

\item{knots}{breakpoints that define the spline.  The default is no
    knots; together with the natural boundary conditions this results in
    a basis for linear regression on \code{x}.  Typical values are the
    mean or median for one knot, quantiles for more knots.  See also
    \code{Boundary.knots}.}

\item{basis_mat}{The matrix of basis kernels to convolve. This is
`NULL` until computed by [prep.recipe()].}

\item{default}{Passed to `dplyr::lag`, determines what fills empty rows
left by lagging (defaults to NA).}

\item{prefix}{A prefix for generated column names, default to "lag_".}

\item{columns}{A character string of variable names that will
be populated (eventually) by the `terms` argument.}

\item{skip}{A logical. Should the step be skipped when the
recipe is baked by \code{\link[recipes:bake]{bake.recipe()}}? While all operations are baked
when \code{\link[recipes:prep]{prep.recipe()}} is run, some operations may not be able to be
conducted on new data (e.g. processing the outcome variable(s)).
Care should be taken when using \code{skip = TRUE} as it may affect
the computations for subsequent operations.}

\item{id}{A character string that is unique to this step to identify it.}
}
\description{
`step_distributed_lag` creates a *specification* of a recipe step that
  will add new columns of lagged data. Lagged data will
  by default include NA values where the lag was induced.
  These can be removed with [step_naomit()], or you may
  specify an alternative filler value with the `default`
  argument.
}
\details{
The step assumes that the data are already _in the proper sequential
 order_ for lagging.

\examples{
n <- 100
start <- as.Date('1999/01/01')
end <- as.Date('1999/01/10')

df <- data.frame(x = runif(n),
                 index = 1:n,
                 day = seq(start, end, by = "day"))

rec <- recipe(~ ., data = df) |>
  step_distributed_lag(index, knots = c(0,4,6)) |>
  prep(df) |>
  bake(df)
