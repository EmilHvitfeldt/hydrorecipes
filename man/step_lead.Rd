\title{Create a lead predictor}
\usage{
step_lead(
  recipe,
  ...,
  role = "predictor",
  trained = FALSE,
  lead = 1,
  prefix = "lead_",
  default = NA,
  columns = NULL,
  skip = FALSE,
  id = rand_id("lead")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{recipe}{A recipe object. The step will be added to the
sequence of operations for this recipe.}

\item{...}{One or more selector functions to choose variables
for this step. See \code{\link[recipes:selections]{selections()}} for more details.}

\item{role}{For model terms created by this step, what analysis role should
they be assigned? By default, the new columns created by this step from
the original variables will be used as \emph{predictors} in a model.}

\item{trained}{A logical to indicate if the quantities for
preprocessing have been estimated.}

\item{lead}{A vector of positive integers. Each specified column will be
lead for each value in the vector.}

\item{prefix}{A prefix for generated column names, default to "lead_".}

\item{default}{Passed to `dplyr::lead`, determines what fills empty rows
left by leading (defaults to NA).}

\item{columns}{A character string of variable names that will
be populated (eventually) by the `terms` argument.}

\item{skip}{A logical. Should the step be skipped when the
recipe is baked by \code{\link[recipes:bake]{bake()}}? While all operations are baked
when \code{\link[recipes:prep]{prep()}} is run, some operations may not be able to be
conducted on new data (e.g. processing the outcome variable(s)).
Care should be taken when using \code{skip = TRUE} as it may affect
the computations for subsequent operations.}

\item{id}{A character string that is unique to this step to identify it.}
}
\description{
`step_lead` creates a *specification* of a recipe step that
  will add new columns of lead data. lead data will
  by default include NA values where the lead was induced.
  These can be removed with [step_naomit()], or you may
  specify an alternative filler value with the `default`
  argument.
}
\details{
The step assumes that the data are already _in the proper sequential
 order_ for leading.

\examples{
n <- 10
start <- as.Date('1999/01/01')
end <- as.Date('1999/01/10')

df <- data.frame(x = runif(n),
                 index = 1:n,
                 day = seq(start, end, by = "day"))

recipe(~ ., data = df) |>
  step_lead(index, day, lead = 2:3) |>
  prep() |>
  bake(df)
